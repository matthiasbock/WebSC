The gpgme_key_t type is a pointer to a key object. It has the following members:

	gpgme_keylist_mode_t keylist_mode
		The keylist mode that was active when the key was retrieved. 
	unsigned int revoked : 1
		This is true if the key is revoked. 
	unsigned int expired : 1
		This is true if the key is expired. 
	unsigned int disabled : 1
		This is true if the key is disabled. 
	unsigned int invalid : 1
		This is true if the key is invalid. This might have several reasons, for a example for the S/MIME backend, it will be set in during key listsing if the key could not be validated due to a missing certificates or unmatched policies. 
	unsigned int can_encrypt : 1
		This is true if the key (ie one of its subkeys) can be used for encryption. 
	unsigned int can_sign : 1
		This is true if the key (ie one of its subkeys) can be used to create data signatures. 
	unsigned int can_certify : 1
		This is true if the key (ie one of its subkeys) can be used to create key certificates. 
	unsigned int can_authenticate : 1
		This is true if the key (ie one of its subkeys) can be used for authentication. 
	unsigned int is_qualified : 1
		This is true if the key can be used for qualified signatures according to local government regulations. 
	unsigned int secret : 1
		This is true if the key is a secret key. Note, that this will always be true even if the corresponding subkey flag may be false (offline/stub keys). 
	gpgme_protocol_t protocol
		This is the protocol supported by this key. 
	char *issuer_serial
		If protocol is GPGME_PROTOCOL_CMS, then this is the issuer serial. 
	char *issuer_name
		If protocol is GPGME_PROTOCOL_CMS, then this is the issuer name. 
	char *chain_id
		If protocol is GPGME_PROTOCOL_CMS, then this is the chain ID, which can be used to built the certificate chain. 
	gpgme_validity_t owner_trust
		If protocol is GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP, then this is the owner trust. 
	gpgme_sub_key_t subkeys
		This is a linked list with the subkeys of the key. The first subkey in the list is the primary key and usually available. 
	gpgme_user_id_t uids
		This is a linked list with the user IDs of the key. The first user ID in the list is the main (or primary) user ID.


The subkey structure has the following members:

	gpgme_sub_key_t next
		This is a pointer to the next subkey structure in the linked list, or NULL if this is the last element. 
	unsigned int revoked : 1
		This is true if the subkey is revoked. 
	unsigned int expired : 1
		This is true if the subkey is expired. 
	unsigned int disabled : 1
		This is true if the subkey is disabled. 
	unsigned int invalid : 1
		This is true if the subkey is invalid. 
	unsigned int can_encrypt : 1
		This is true if the subkey can be used for encryption. 
	unsigned int can_sign : 1
		This is true if the subkey can be used to create data signatures. 
	unsigned int can_certify : 1
		This is true if the subkey can be used to create key certificates. 
	unsigned int can_authenticate : 1
		This is true if the subkey can be used for authentication. 
	unsigned int is_qualified : 1
		This is true if the subkey can be used for qualified signatures according to local government regulations. 
	unsigned int secret : 1
		This is true if the subkey is a secret key. Note that it will be false if the key is actually a stub key; i.e. a secret key operation is currently not possible (offline-key). 
	gpgme_pubkey_algo_t pubkey_algo
		This is the public key algorithm supported by this subkey. 
	unsigned int length
		This is the length of the subkey (in bits). 
	char *keyid
		This is the key ID of the subkey in hexadecimal digits. 
	char *fpr
		This is the fingerprint of the subkey in hexadecimal digits, if available. 
	long int timestamp
		This is the creation timestamp of the subkey. This is -1 if the timestamp is invalid, and 0 if it is not available. 
	long int expires
		This is the expiration timestamp of the subkey, or 0 if the subkey does not expire.


The key signature structure has the following members:

	gpgme_key_sig_t next
		This is a pointer to the next key signature structure in the linked list, or NULL if this is the last element. 
	unsigned int revoked : 1
		This is true if the key signature is a revocation signature. 
	unsigned int expired : 1
		This is true if the key signature is expired. 
	unsigned int invalid : 1
		This is true if the key signature is invalid. 
	unsigned int exportable : 1
		This is true if the key signature is exportable. 
	gpgme_pubkey_algo_t pubkey_algo
		This is the public key algorithm used to create the signature. 
	char *keyid
		This is the key ID of the key (in hexadecimal digits) used to create the signature. 
	long int timestamp
		This is the creation timestamp of the key signature. This is -1 if the timestamp is invalid, and 0 if it is not available. 
	long int expires
		This is the expiration timestamp of the key signature, or 0 if the key signature does not expire. 
	gpgme_error_t status
		This is the status of the signature and has the same meaning as the member of the same name in a gpgme_signature_t object. 
	unsigned int sig_class
		This specifies the signature class of the key signature. The meaning is specific to the crypto engine. 
	char *uid
		This is the main user ID of the key used to create the signature. 
	char *name
		This is the name component of uid, if available. 
	char *comment
		This is the comment component of uid, if available. 
	char *email
		This is the email component of uid, if available. 
	gpgme_sig_notation_t notations
		This is a linked list with the notation data and policy URLs.


The user ID structure has the following members.

	gpgme_user_id_t next
		This is a pointer to the next user ID structure in the linked list, or NULL if this is the last element. 
	unsigned int revoked : 1
		This is true if the user ID is revoked. 
	unsigned int invalid : 1
		This is true if the user ID is invalid. 
	gpgme_validity_t validity
		This specifies the validity of the user ID. 
	char *uid
		This is the user ID string. 
	char *name
		This is the name component of uid, if available. 
	char *comment
		This is the comment component of uid, if available. 
	char *email
		This is the email component of uid, if available. 
	gpgme_key_sig_t signatures
		This is a linked list with the signatures on this user ID.
